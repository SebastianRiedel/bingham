OLF
---

NOW:
 - Make OLF (Oriented Local Feature) library
 - load_pcd()
 - load_olf()
 - sope_sample()
 - sope_cloud_pdf()
 - qksample()




-------
BINGHAM
-------

NOW:
 - bingham_mixture_sample()
 - pmf_sample()
 - Use bingham_F_lookup_3d() in bingham_new()
 - Check for 0 mixtures in bingham_cluster
 - Triangular meshing of S2


SOON:
 - Bingham importance sampling
 - Speed optimizations
 - Test for memory leaks (continuous operation)


DONE:
 + Use ACG as proposal distribution in bingham_sample()
 + Angular Central Gaussian sampling and pdf
 + Improve bingham_sample() with rejection sampling
 + bingham_sample()
 + Multivariate normal sampling and pdf
 + Add function "F = bingham_F_lookup_3d(Z)" to bingham_constants.c
 + Improve speed of bingham_discretize()
 + Test speed of bingham_discretize()
 + Test speed of bingham_sample()
 + Cache hypersphere tessellations
 + Fix sample_simplex()
 + Test bingham_sample()
 + Test bingham_pdf()
 + Test bingham_discretize()
 + Use safe_alloc()
 + Fast normalization constant lookup
 + Use graph traversal to avoid saving redundant faces to PLY files.
