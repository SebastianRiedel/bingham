NOW:
 - Check for 0 mixtures in bingham_cluster
 - Triangular meshing of S2


SOON:
 - Test speed of bingham_pdf()
 - Test for memory leaks (continuous operation)


DONE:
 + Add function "F = bingham_F_lookup_3d(Z)" to bingham_constants.c
 + Improve speed of bingham_discretize()
 + Test speed of bingham_discretize()
 + Test speed of bingham_sample()
 + Cache hypersphere tessellations
 + Fix sample_simplex()
 + Test bingham_sample()
 + Test bingham_pdf()
 + Test bingham_discretize()
 + Use safe_alloc()
 + Fast normalization constant lookup
 + Use graph traversal to avoid saving redundant faces to PLY files.
